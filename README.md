# Semantic-Markup

## Description

- This is my first homework for Full Stack Web Development.
- Homework assignment was to refactor an existing working webpage and update the HTML code tag <> names with SEO- Search Engine Optimization Elements
- SEO helps search engines, other developers, and end users with visual disabilities find information quicker 
- This assignment exposed me to non-semantic elements such as div and span
- I learned the importance of using proper semantic markup
- I learned some history of HTML and why HTML5 is useful for structuring HTML code


The following is a screenshot of the webpage that was refactored for this homework assignment
